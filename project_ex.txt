A deep learning-based automatic speech recognition model, Whisper from the Transformers library, was utilized and fine-tuned for Odia, a low-resource language. This optimization reduced the character error rate from 85% to 25%, demonstrating expertise in model fine-tuning, low-resource language processing, and speech recognition.

Developed a small language model from scratch using pure PyTorch to demonstrate self-supervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, creating a basic chatbot.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Designed and implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the LLaMA model to generate context-aware responses to questions about the Bhagavad Gita. Advanced techniques such as text chunking, text encoding, vector embeddings, and similarity search with a vector database were employed to enhance retrieval accuracy. Optimized performance using 8-bit and 4-bit quantization for efficient memory usage, ensuring seamless deployment.  

Developed deep learning models using Python, TensorFlow, and LLM-based techniques to estimate the remaining useful life of industrial components, improving prediction accuracy by 37%.

Designed hybrid fault diagnosis methods using advanced modeling with MATLAB, TensorFlow, and transformer-based architectures, reducing reliance on labeled data by 55%. Managed international research collaborations, published first-authored journal papers, and presented findings at national and international conferences.
