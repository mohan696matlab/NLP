      "\n",
      "The Bhagavad-Gita is a doctrine of universal truth and a book of moral and spiritual growth. Its message is sublime and non-sectarian. It deals with the most sacred metaphysical science. It imparts the knowledge of the Self and answers two universal questions: Who am I, and how can I lead a happy and peaceful life in this word full of dualities and dilemmas?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a timeless book of wisdom that inspired Thoreau, Emerson, Einstein, Oppenheimer, Gandhi and many others. The BhagavadGita teaches us how to equip ourselves for the battle of life. A repeated study with faith purifies our psyche and guides us to face the challenges of modern living leading to inner peace and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gita teaches the spiritual science of Self-realization (SR) based on the essence of Upanishads and Vedanta. The prime message of the Gita is: The ultimate purpose of life is to realize one's essential nature and become one with the Supreme Self within all of us. It assures spiritual progress for all humans, and how to be one with the Supreme. Its teachings are profound, universal, uplifting, and sublime.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  ignorance  of  metaphysical  or  Spiritual  knowledge-not knowing our real identity-is humanity's greatest predicament. It is said that there is no human mind that cannot be purified by a repeated study of the Gita. Gita explains the basic principles of spiritual science- using Sanskrit poetry- in a very clear and inspiring manner. Sacred relationship between the Creator and the creation is well established in the Gita. If one lives in the spirit of even a few verses of the Gita, one's life will be transformed into divinity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The philosophy of duty, devotion and Self-knowledge is wonderfully synthesized and harmonized in the Gita-without creating any conflict among them-to give the reader eternal bliss, everlasting peace and perennial joy in life. It awakens Cosmic Consciousness and stimulates life with spirituality. Religion tends to create a wall of division and conflicts along religious lines. Whereas, spirituality unites people by breaking those walls. A spiritual person is a\n",
      "\n",
      "friend  of  all  and  a  foe  of  none,  because  he  considers  all  creatures-living or non-living-as part and parcel of the Cosmic body of the Absolute, the Source.\n",
      "\n",
      "The message of the Gita came to humanity due to Arjuna's unwillingness to do his duty as a warrior, because fighting involved destruction and killing. Nonviolence or Ahinsa is one of the most fundamental tenets of spiritual culture. All lives, human or non-human, are sacred. This immortal discourse between the Supreme Lord, Krishna, and His devotee-friend, Arjuna, occurs not in a temple, a secluded forest, or on a mountain top; but on a battlefield on the eve of a big war. Anyone can be helped by practice of only a few of its teachings. No change of one's faith or life-style is needed!\n",
      "\n",
      "A total of seven hundred (700) verses of the Gita, in 18 chapters,  are  recorded  in  world's  longest  epic,  Mahabharata,  having over 100,000 verses in Sanskrit poetry. In Gita Lord Krishna advises Arjuna to get up and fight. This may create a misunderstanding of the principles of non-violence if the background of the war of Mahabharata is not kept in mind. Therefore, a brief historical description is in order.\n",
      "\n",
      "In  ancient  times  there  was  a  king  who  had  two  sons,  Dhritarashtra and Pandu. The former was born blind; therefore, Pandu inherited the kingdom. Pandu had five sons. They were called the Pandavas. Dhritarashtra had one hundred sons. They were called the Kauravas. Duryodhana was the eldest of the Kauravas.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the death of king Pandu, the eldest son of Pandu became the lawful King. Duryodhana was a very jealous person. He also wanted the kingdom. The kingdom was divided into two halves between the Pandavas and the Kauravas.  Duryodhana was not satisfied with his share of the kingdom. He wanted the entire kingdom for himself. He unsuccessfully planned several foul plays to kill the Pandavas and take away their kingdom also. He unlawfully took possession of the entire kingdom of the Pandavas and refused to give back even an acre of land without a war. All mediation by Lord Krishna and others failed. The big war of Mahabharata was thus inevitable.  The  Pandavas  were  unwilling  participants.  They  had only two choices: Fight for their right as a matter of duty or run away from war and accept defeat for the sake of peace and nonviolence.  Arjuna,  one  of  the  five  Pandava  brothers,  faced  this  dilemma in the battlefield: Whether to fight or run away from war for peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arjuna's dilemma is, in reality, the Universal Dilemma. All human beings face dilemmas, big or small, in their everyday life while performing their duties. Arjuna's dilemma was a big one. He had to make  a  choice  between  fighting  the  war  and  killing  his  most revered guru who was on the other side, very dear friends, close relatives, and many innocent warriors; or running away from the\n",
      "\n",
      "battlefield for the sake of preserving peace and nonviolence. The entire seven hundred verses of the Bhagavad-Gita are a discourse between Lord Krishna and the confused Arjuna on the battlefield near New Delhi, India, in 3,139 BCE. This discourse was narrated to the blind king, Dhritarashtra, by his charioteer, Sanjaya, as an eyewitness war report.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word 'Bhagavad' means the Supreme Being, God or Bhagavan in Sanskrit. 'Gita' means song. Thus, Bhagavad-Gita means the Song of God or The Celestial Song, because it was sung by Bhagavan Lord Krishna, an incarnation of God Himself.\n",

      "Sanjaya said: Arjuna asked his charioteer-friend, Lord Krishna, to drive his chariot between the two armies so that he could see the armies on both sides. Arjuna felt great compassion to see his friends and relatives on the opposite side, whom he must kill to win this war. He became confused, spoke of the evils of war, and refused to fight or do his duty as a warrior.\n",

      "The Supreme Lord said: You grieve for those who are not worthy of grief; and yet speak words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. (2.11) There was never a time when these monarchs, you, or I did not exist, nor shall we ever cease to exist in the future. (2.12) Just as a living being acquires a childhood body, a youth body, and an old-age body during this life; similarly, it acquires another new body after death. The wise are not  deluded  by  this.  (2.13)  The  contacts  of  the  senses  with  the sense objects give rise to the feelings of heat and cold, pain and pleasure. They are transitory and impermanent. Therefore, learn to endure them, O Arjuna, (2.14) because a calm person - who is not  afflicted  by  these  sense  objects,  and  is  steady  in  pain  and pleasure - becomes fit for immortality, O Arjuna. (2.15)\n",

      "## The spirit is eternal, body is transitory\n",
      "\n",
      "The invisible Spirit is eternal, and the visible world, including the physical body, is transitory. The reality of these two is indeed certainly seen by the seers of Truth. (2.16) The Spirit by which all this universe is pervaded is indestructible. No one can destroy the imperishable Spirit. (2.17) Bodies of the eternal, immutable, and incomprehensible Spirit are perishable. Therefore, fight, O Arjuna. (2.18) One who thinks that Spirit is a slayer, and one who thinks Spirit is slain, are both ignorant. Because Spirit neither slays nor is slain. (2.19) The Spirit is neither born nor does it die at any time. It does not come into being, or cease to exist. It is unborn, eternal, permanent,  and  primeval.  The  Spirit  is  not  destroyed  when  the body is destroyed. (2.20) O Arjuna, how can a person who knows that the Spirit is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable, kill anyone or cause anyone to be killed? (2.21)\n",

      "Just as a person puts on new garments after discarding the old ones; similarly, the living entity acquires new bodies after casting away the old bodies. (2.22)  Weapons do not cut this Spirit, fire does not burn it, water does not make it wet, and the wind does not make it dry. Spirit cannot be cut, burned, wet, or dried. It is eternal, all-pervading,  unchanging,  immovable,  and  primeval.  (2.23-24) The Spirit is said to be unexplainable, incomprehensible, and unchanging. Knowing this Spirit as such, you should not grieve. (2.25)\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you think that this living being takes birth and dies perpetually, even then, O Arjuna, you should not grieve like this. Because, death is certain for one who is born, and birth is certain for one who dies; and the cycle of birth-death continues. Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable. (2.26-27) All beings, O Arjuna, are unmanifest - invisible to our physical eyes - before birth  and  after  death.  They  manifest  between  the  birth  and  the death only. What is there to grieve about? (2.28) Some look upon\n",

      "## Duty of a warrior\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering also your duty as a warrior, you should not waver. Because there is nothing more auspicious for a warrior than a righteous war. (2.31) Only the fortunate warriors, O Arjuna, get such an opportunity for a righteous war against evil that is like an open door to heaven. (2.32)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Commentary\n",
      "\n",
      "The  righteous  war  is  not  a  religious  war  against  the followers of other religions. The righteous war may be waged even  against  our  own  evil-doer  kith  and  kin  (RigVeda 6.75.19). Life is a continuous battle between the forces of evil and goodness. 'Whosoever kills an innocent human being, it shall be regarded as if he has killed the entire humanity.' (Surah 5.32).\n",
      "\n",
      "It  is  better  to  die  for  a  right  cause  and  acquire  the  grace  of sacrifice than to die an ordinary but compulsory death. The gates of heaven open wide for those who stand up to vindicate justice and righteousness (Dharma). Not to oppose an evil is to indirectly support it. Very similar ideas are expressed in other scriptures of the world. The Bible says: Happy are those who suffer persecution because  they  do  what  God  requires.  The  kingdom  of  heaven belongs to them (MATTHEW 5.10). There is no sin in killing an aggressor. Whosoever helps and supports an aggressor is also an aggressor. Thus, all those who supported Kauravas were basically aggressors and deserved to be eliminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you will not fight this righteous war, then you will fail in your duty,  lose  your  reputation,  and  incur  sin.  (2.33)  People  will  talk about your disgrace forever. To the honored, dishonor is worse than death. (2.34) The great warriors will think that you have retreated  from  the  battle  out  of  fear.  Those  who  have  greatly  esteemed  you  will  lose  respect  for  you.  (2.35)  Your  enemies  will speak  many  unmentionable  words  and  scorn  your  ability.  What could be more painful to you than this? (2.36) You will go to heaven if killed in the line of duty, or you will enjoy the kingdom on the earth if victorious. Therefore, get up with a determination to fight, O Arjuna. (2.37) Treating pleasure and pain, gain and loss, and victory and defeat alike, engage yourself in your duty.

God  is pleased by the sacrifice (Qurbani) of self-interest: The selfless philanthropic work, and blesses selfless persons. Selfless work or sacrifice is our duty. Duty is prescribed in the scriptures. The scriptures come from God. Thus, the all-pervading God is ever present in selfless service, Seva.

(18.20) The knowledge by which one sees different realities of various types among all beings as separate from one another; such knowledge is in the mode of passion. (18.21) The irrational, baseless, and worthless knowledge by which one clings to one single effect, such as the body, as if it is everything, such knowledge is declared to be in the mode of darkness or ignorance (18.22)\n",

(18.30) That intellect is in the mode of passion which cannot distinguish between righteousness and unrighteousness, and right and wrong action, O Arjuna.

(18.45) One attains perfection by worshipping the Supreme Being-from whom all beings originate, and by whom  all  this  universe  is  pervaded  -  through  performance  of one's natural duty for Him. (18.46) One's inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work even though well performed. One who does the work ordained by one's inherent nature without selfish  motives  incurs  no  sin  or  Karmic  bondage.  (18.47)  One's natural work, even though defective, should not be abandoned because all undertakings are enveloped by defects as fire is covered by smoke, O Arjuna. (18.48) The person whose mind is always free from attachment, who has subdued the mind and senses, and who is  free  from  desires,  attains  the  supreme  perfection  of  freedom from the bondage of Karma by renouncing attachment to the fruits of work. (18.49)\n",
      "\n",
      "Learn from Me briefly, O Arjuna, how one who has attained such perfection - the freedom from the bondage of Karma - attains the Supreme Person, the goal of spiritual knowledge. (18.50) Endowed with purified intellect, subduing the mind with firm resolve, turning away from sound and other objects of the senses, giving up likes and dislikes; living in solitude; eating lightly; controlling the mind, speech, and organs of action; ever absorbed in yoga of meditation; taking refuge in detachment; and relinquishing egotism, violence,  pride,  lust,  anger,  and  proprietorship  -  one  becomes peaceful, free from the notion of \"I' and 'my\", and fit for attaining oneness with the Supreme Being. (18.51-53) Absorbed in the Supreme Being, the serene one neither grieves nor desires. Becoming impartial to all beings, one obtains My Para-Bhakti, the highest devotional love. (18.54) By devotion one truly understands what and who I am in essence. Having known Me in essence, one immediately merges with Me. (18.55)\n",
      "\n",
      "A Karma-yogi attains the eternal immutable abode, by My grace - even while doing all duties - just by dedicating all action to Me with loving devotion. (18.56) Sincerely offer all actions to Me, set Me as your supreme goal, and completely depend on Me. Always fix your mind on Me and resort to Karma-yoga. (18.57) When your mind becomes fixed on Me, you shall overcome all difficulties by My grace. But, if you do not listen to Me due to ego, you shall perish. (18.58)\n",
      "\n",
      "If  due to ego you think: I shall not fight, your resolve is vain. Because your own nature will compel you to fight. (18.59) O Arjuna, you are controlled by your own nature-born Karmic impressions (or Samskara). Therefore, you shall do - even against your will - what you do not wish to do out of delusion. (18.60) The Supreme Lord, Krishna or God, abiding as the controller in the inner psyche of all beings, O Arjuna, causes them to evolve - or work out their Karma - like a puppet of Karma, mounted on a machine. (18.61)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Supreme Controller is the reflection of the Supreme Spirit in the body. The  Supreme  Lord  organizes, controls, supervises, and directs everything in the universe. Human being is like a puppet of Karma mounted on a body which is the vehicle of transmigration. The word evolve refers to working out one's Karma. Thus we become the puppet of our own Karma created by our free will.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  Lord  has  made  Karmic  laws  as  the  controller  of  all living beings. Therefore, one must learn to gladly endure all that fate imposes by taking refuge in God and following His commandments. Vedas declare  that  the  Lord,  using  His  law  of Karma,  makes  us  dance  as  a  juggler  would  make  his  monkey dance.  Without  the  laws  of  Karma;  the  scriptural  injunctions, prohibitions,  as  well  as  self-effort,  would  have  no  value  at  all. Karma is the eternal justice and the eternal law. As a result of the working of eternal justice, there can be no escape from the consequences of our deeds. We become the product of our own past thinking and action. Therefore, we must think and act wisely at the present moment, using the scriptures as a guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctrine of Karma and reincarnation is also found in the following two verses of the Koran: Allah is He who created you and then sustained you, then causes you to die, then gives life to you again (Surah 30.40). He may reward those who believe and do good works. No one is able to escape His law of consequences (Surah 30.45). People cannot escape from the consequences of their deeds, for as we sow, so we reap. Cause and effect cannot be separated because the effect exists in the cause as the fruit exists in the seed. Good and evil deeds follow us continually like our shadows.\n",

It is believed that all references to Karma and reincarnation were taken out of the Bible during  the  second  century  with  the  noble  aim  of  encouraging people to strive hard for perfection during this very life.

(18.65) Setting aside doership, ownership and attachment to the fruits of all works, just surrender toor gladly abide by- My Will. I shall liberate you from all sins or bondage of Karma. Do not grieve. (18.66)\n",
      "\n",
      "The meaning of abandoning all duties and taking refuge in God is that one should perform duty without ego and attachment to results; as an offering to the Lord, and totally depend only on Him. The Lord takes full responsibility for a person who totally depends on Him and understands: All is manifestation of the One.\n",

      "To speak of wisdom to a deluded person, to glorify sacrifice to a greedy person, to advise sense control to an irascible person, and to discourse on Lord Rama's exploits to a lecher, is as useless as sowing seed on barren ground. It is not for any soul to believe, save by the permission of Allah. You should not compel one to believe  (Surah  10.100-101).  Anyone  to  whom  Allah  has  not granted the light (of knowledge) will have no light (Surah 24.40). The study of Gita or any other scripture is meant only for sincere persons. According to Ramakrishna, one can understand Him as much as He makes one understand. Guru Nanak said: O Beloved; only they to whom You give the divine knowledge, obtain it.\n",

He unsuccessfully planned several foul plays to kill the Pandavas and take away their kingdom also. He unlawfully took possession of the entire kingdom of the Pandavas and refused to give back even an acre of land without a war. All mediation by Lord Krishna and others failed. The big war of Mahabharata was thus inevitable.  The  Pandavas  were  unwilling  participants.

It imparts the knowledge of the Self and answers two universal questions: Who am I, and how can I lead a happy and peaceful life in this word full of dualities and dilemmas?  \\nIt's a timeless book of wisdom that inspired Thoreau, Emerson, Einstein, Oppenheimer, Gandhi and many others. The BhagavadGita teaches us how to equip ourselves for the battle of life. A repeated study with faith purifies our psyche and guides us to face the challenges of modern living leading to inner peace and happiness.  \\nGita teaches the spiritual science of Self-realization (SR) based on the essence of Upanishads and Vedanta. The prime message of the Gita is: The ultimate purpose of life is to realize one's essential nature and become one with the Supreme Self within all of us. It assures spiritual progress for all humans, and how to be one with the Supreme. Its teachings are profound, universal, uplifting, and sublime.  \\nThe  ignorance  of  metaphysical  or  Spiritual  knowledge-not knowing our real identity-is humanity's greatest predicament. It is said that there is no human mind that cannot be purified by a repeated study of the Gita. Gita explains the basic principles of spiritual science- using Sanskrit poetry- in a very clear and inspiring manner. Sacred relationship between the Creator and the creation is well established in the Gita. If one lives in the spirit of even a few verses of the Gita, one's life will be transformed into divinity.  \\nThe philosophy of duty, devotion and Self-knowledge is wonderfully synthesized and harmonized in the Gita-without creating any conflict among them-to give the reader eternal bliss, everlasting peace and perennial joy in life. It awakens Cosmic Consciousness and stimulates life with spirituality. Religion tends to create a wall of division and conflicts along religious lines. Whereas, spirituality unites people by breaking those walls. A spiritual person is a  \\nfriend  of  all  and  a  foe  of  none,  because  he  considers  all  creatures-living or non-living-as part and parcel of the Cosmic body of the Absolute, the Source.  \\nThe message of the Gita came to humanity due to Arjuna's unwillingness to do his duty as a warrior, because fighting involved destruction and killing. Nonviolence or Ahinsa is one of the most fundamental tenets of spiritual culture. All lives, human or non-human, are sacred. This immortal discourse between the Supreme Lord, Krishna, and His devotee-friend, Arjuna, occurs not in a temple, a secluded forest, or on a mountain top; but on a battlefield on the eve of a big war. Anyone can be helped by practice of only a few of its teachings. No change of one's faith or life-style is needed!  \\nA total of seven hundred (700) verses of the Gita, in 18 chapters,  are  recorded  in  world's  longest  epic,  Mahabharata,  having over 100,000 verses in Sanskrit poetry. In Gita Lord Krishna advises Arjuna to get up and fight. This may create a misunderstanding of the principles of non-violence if the background of the war of Mahabharata is not kept in mind. Therefore, a brief historical description is in order.  \\nIn  ancient  times  there  was  a  king  who  had  two  sons,  Dhritarashtra and Pandu. The former was born blind; therefore, Pandu inherited the kingdom. Pandu had five sons. They were called the Pandavas. Dhritarashtra had one hundred sons. They were called the Kauravas. Duryodhana was the eldest of the Kauravas.  \\nAfter the death of king Pandu, the eldest son of Pandu became the lawful King. Duryodhana was a very jealous person. He also wanted the kingdom. The kingdom was divided into two halves between the Pandavas and the Kauravas.  Duryodhana was not satisfied with his share of the kingdom. He wanted the entire kingdom for himself. He unsuccessfully planned several foul plays to kill the Pandavas and take away their kingdom also. He unlawfully took possession of the entire kingdom of the Pandavas and refused to give back even an acre of land without a war. All mediation by Lord Krishna and others failed. The big war of Mahabharata was thus inevitable.  The  Pandavas  were  unwilling  participants.  They  had only two choices: Fight for their right as a matter of duty or run away from war and accept defeat for the sake of peace and nonviolence.  Arjuna,  one  of  the  five  Pandava  brothers,  faced  this  dilemma in the battlefield: Whether to fight or run away from war for peace.  \\nArjuna's dilemma is, in reality, the Universal Dilemma. All human beings face dilemmas, big or small, in their everyday life while performing their duties. Arjuna's dilemma was a big one. He had to make  a  choice  between  fighting  the  war  and  killing  his  most revered guru who was on the other side, very dear friends, close relatives, and many innocent warriors; or running away from the  \\nbattlefield for the sake of preserving peace and nonviolence. The entire seven hundred verses of the Bhagavad-Gita are a discourse between Lord Krishna and the confused Arjuna on the battlefield near New Delhi, India, in 3,139 BCE. This discourse was narrated to the blind king, Dhritarashtra, by his charioteer, Sanjaya, as an eyewitness war report.  \\nThe word 'Bhagavad' means the Supreme Being, God or Bhagavan in Sanskrit. 'Gita' means song. Thus, Bhagavad-Gita means the Song of God or The Celestial Song, because it was sung by Bhagavan Lord Krishna, an incarnation of God Himself.\", 'The blind King inquired from his charioteer: O Sanjaya, tell me in detail, what did my sons and the P a ndavas do in the battlefield before the war started? (1.01)', 'Sanjaya said: Arjuna asked his charioteer-friend, Lord Krishna, to drive his chariot between the two armies so that he could see the armies on both sides. Arjuna felt great compassion to see his friends and relatives on the opposite side, whom he must kill to win this war. He became confused, spoke of the evils of war, and refused to fight or do his duty as a warrior.  \\nArjuna sat down on the back seat of the chariot with his mind overwhelmed with sorrow. (Verse 1.47)  \\nNOTE : Some non-essential verses from Chapters 1 and 2 only have been omitted for ease of understanding the teachings of the Gita by the first time readers.', 'Sanjaya said: Lord Krishna spoke these words to Arjuna whose eyes were tearful and downcast, and who was overwhelmed with compassion and despair. (2.01) O King, Lord Krishna, as if smiling, spoke these words to distressed Arjuna in the midst of the two armies. (2.10)', 'Important  verses  are  highlighted.  First  time  readers  should read and understand these verses first.  \\nThe Supreme Lord said: You grieve for those who are not worthy of grief; and yet speak words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. (2.11) There was never a time when these monarchs, you, or I did not exist, nor shall we ever cease to exist in the future. (2.12) Just as a living being acquires a childhood body, a youth body, and an old-age body during this life; similarly, it acquires another new body after death. The wise are not  deluded  by  this.  (2.13)  The  contacts  of  the  senses  with  the sense objects give rise to the feelings of heat and cold, pain and pleasure. They are transitory and impermanent. Therefore, learn to endure them, O Arjuna, (2.14) because a calm person - who is not  afflicted  by  these  sense  objects,  and  is  steady  in  pain  and pleasure - becomes fit for immortality, O Arjuna. (2.15)', 'The invisible Spirit is eternal, and the visible world, including the physical body, is transitory. The reality of these two is indeed certainly seen by the seers of Truth. (2.16) The Spirit by which all this universe is pervaded is indestructible. No one can destroy the imperishable Spirit. (2.17) Bodies of the eternal, immutable, and incomprehensible Spirit are perishable. Therefore, fight, O Arjuna. (2.18) One who thinks that Spirit is a slayer, and one who thinks Spirit is slain, are both ignorant. Because Spirit neither slays nor is slain. (2.19) The Spirit is neither born nor does it die at any time. It does not come into being, or cease to exist. It is unborn, eternal, permanent,  and  primeval.  The  Spirit  is  not  destroyed  when  the body is destroyed. (2.20) O Arjuna, how can a person who knows that the Spirit is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable, kill anyone or cause anyone to be killed? (2.21)  \\nDeath and Reincarnation of the soul  \\nJust as a person puts on new garments after discarding the old ones; similarly, the living entity acquires new bodies after casting away the old bodies. (2.22)  Weapons do not cut this Spirit, fire does not burn it, water does not make it wet, and the wind does not make it dry. Spirit cannot be cut, burned, wet, or dried. It is eternal, all-pervading,  unchanging,  immovable,  and  primeval.  (2.23-24) The Spirit is said to be unexplainable, incomprehensible, and unchanging. Knowing this Spirit as such, you should not grieve. (2.25)  \\nEven if you think that this living being takes birth and dies perpetually, even then, O Arjuna, you should not grieve like this. Because, death is certain for one who is born, and birth is certain for one who dies; and the cycle of birth-death continues. Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable. (2.26-27) All beings, O Arjuna, are unmanifest - invisible to our physical eyes - before birth  and  after  death.  They  manifest  between  the  birth  and  the death only. What is there to grieve about? (2.28) Some look upon  \\nthis Spirit as a wonder, another describes it as wonderful, and others hear of it as a wonder. Even after hearing about it very few people know it. (2.29) O Arjuna, the Spirit that dwells in the body of all beings is eternally indestructible. Therefore, you should not mourn for anybody. (2.30)', 'Considering also your duty as a warrior, you should not waver. Because there is nothing more auspicious for a warrior than a righteous war. (2.31) Only the fortunate warriors, O Arjuna, get such an opportunity for a righteous war against evil that is like an open door to heaven. (2.32)', \"The  righteous  war  is  not  a  religious  war  against  the followers of other religions. The righteous war may be waged even  against  our  own  evil-doer  kith  and  kin  (RigVeda 6.75.19). Life is a continuous battle between the forces of evil and goodness. 'Whosoever kills an innocent human being, it shall be regarded as if he has killed the entire humanity.' (Surah 5.32).  \\nIt  is  better  to  die  for  a  right  cause  and  acquire  the  grace  of sacrifice than to die an ordinary but compulsory death. The gates of heaven open wide for those who stand up to vindicate justice and righteousness (Dharma). Not to oppose an evil is to indirectly support it. Very similar ideas are expressed in other scriptures of the world. The Bible says: Happy are those who suffer persecution because  they  do  what  God  requires.  The  kingdom  of  heaven belongs to them (MATTHEW 5.10). There is no sin in killing an aggressor. Whosoever helps and supports an aggressor is also an aggressor. Thus, all those who supported Kauravas were basically aggressors and deserved to be eliminated.  \\nIf you will not fight this righteous war, then you will fail in your duty,  lose  your  reputation,  and  incur  sin.  (2.33)  People  will  talk about your disgrace forever. To the honored, dishonor is worse than death. (2.34) The great warriors will think that you have retreated  from  the  battle  out  of  fear.  Those  who  have  greatly  esteemed  you  will  lose  respect  for  you.  (2.35)  Your  enemies  will speak  many  unmentionable  words  and  scorn  your  ability.  What could be more painful to you than this? (2.36) You will go to heaven if killed in the line of duty, or you will enjoy the kingdom on the earth if victorious. Therefore, get up with a determination to fight, O Arjuna. (2.37) Treating pleasure and pain, gain and loss, and victory and defeat alike, engage yourself in your duty. By doing your duty this way, you will not incur sin. (2.38)\", 'The wisdom of spiritual knowledge has been imparted to you, O Arjuna. Now listen to the wisdom of Karma-yoga, the selfless  \\nservice (Seva), endowed with which you will free yourself from the bondage or reactions of action (Karma). (2.39) In Karma-yoga, no effort is ever lost and there is no adverse effect. Even a little practice of this discipline protects one from the great fear of birth and death. (2.40) A Karma-yogi has a resolute determination for Godrealization, O Arjuna, but the desires of one who works to enjoy the fruits of work are endless. (2.41)', \"The misguided ones who delight in the melodious chanting of the Vedas or any scripture - without understanding its real purpose - think, O Arjuna, as if there is nothing else in it except the rituals for the sole purpose of obtaining heavenly enjoyment. (2.42) They are dominated by material desires and consider the attainment of heaven as the highest goal of life. They engage in specific rites for the sake of prosperity and enjoyment. Rebirth is the result of their action. (2.43) The resolute determination of Self-realization is not formed in the minds of those who are attached to pleasure and power and whose judgment is obscured by such ritualistic activities.  (2.44)  A  portion of the Vedas deals with three modes or states of the material Nature. Become free from pairs of opposites; be ever balanced and unconcerned with the thoughts of acquisition and preservation. Rise above the three states, and be Self-conscious, O Arjuna. (2.45) To a Self-realized person, scriptures are as useful as a small reservoir of water when the water of a huge lake becomes available. (2.46)  \\nTheory and practice of Karma-yoga  \\nYou have control over your respective duty only, but no control or claim over the results. The fruits of work should not be your only motive and you should never be inactive. (2.47) Do your duty to the best of your ability, O Arjuna, with your mind attached to the Lord, abandoning worry and attachment to the results, and remaining  calm  in  both  success  and  failure.  The  calmness  of  mind  is called Karma-yoga. (2.48) Work done with selfish motives is inferior  by  far  to  selfless  service  or  Karma-yoga.  Therefore,  be  a Karma-yogi, O Arjuna. Those who work only to enjoy the fruits of their labor are, in truth, unhappy. Because, one has no control over the results. (2.49)  \\nA true Karma-yogi becomes free from both vice and virtue in this very life. Therefore, strive for Karma-yoga. Working to the best of one's abilities without becoming attached to the fruits of work is called  Karma-yoga. (2.50) Wise Karma-yogis are freed from the bondage of rebirth  by  renouncing  attachment  to  the  fruits  of  all work and attain a blissful divine state. (2.51) When your intellect completely pierces the veil of confusion, then you will become indifferent to what has been heard and what is to be heard from the scriptures. (2.52)  \\nWhen your intellect, that is confused by the conflicting opinions and the ritualistic doctrine of the Vedas, shall stay steady and firm on concentrating on the Supreme Being, then you shall attain union with the Supreme Being in trance. (2.53) Arjuna said: O Krishna, what are the  marks  of  an  enlightened  person  whose  intellect  is steady? How does a person of steady intellect speak? How does such a person sit and walk? (2.54)\", 'The Supreme Lord said: When one is completely free from all desires of the mind and is satisfied with the Eternal Being (God) by the joy of Eternal Being, then one is called an enlightened person, O Arjuna. (2.55) A person whose mind is unperturbed by sorrow, who does not crave pleasures - and who is completely free from attachment,  fear,  and  anger-  is  called  a  sage  of  steady  mind. (2.56) Those who are not attached to anything, who are neither elated by getting desired results, nor troubled by undesired results, their  intellect  is  considered  steady.  (2.57)  When  one  can  completely withdraw the senses from its sense objects- as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into the shell for protection from dangers- then the intellect of such a person is considered steady. (2.58) The desire for sensual pleasures fades away if one abstains from sense enjoyment, but the craving for sense enjoyment remains. The craving also disappears from one who has known the Supreme Being. (2.59)', \"Restless  senses,  O  Arjuna,  forcibly  carry  away  the  mind  of even a wise person striving for perfection. (2.60) One should fix one's  mind  on  Me  with  loving  contemplation  after  bringing  the senses under control. One's intellect becomes steady when one's senses are under complete control. (2.61) One develops attachment to sense objects by thinking about sense objects. Desire for sense objects comes from attachment to sense objects, and anger comes from unfulfilled desires. (2.62) Delusion or wild ideas arise from anger. The mind is bewildered by delusion. Reasoning is destroyed when the mind is bewildered. One falls from the right path when reasoning is destroyed. (2.63)\", \"A disciplined person, enjoying sense objects with senses that are under control and free from likes and dislikes, attains tranquility. (2.64) All sorrows are destroyed upon attainment of tranquility. The intellect of such a tranquil person soon becomes completely steady and united with the Source. (2.65) There is neither Selfknowledge nor Self-perception to those who are not united with the Eternal Being. Without Self-perception there is no peace, and without peace there can be no happiness. (2.66)  \\nThe mind, when controlled by roving senses, steals away the intellect as a storm takes away a boat on the sea from its destination - the spiritual shore. (2.67) Therefore, O Arjuna, one's intellect becomes steady when the senses are completely withdrawn from its sense objects. (2.68) A yogi, the person of self-restraint, remains wakeful when it is night for all others. It is night for a yogi who sees when all others are wakeful. (2.69)  \\nNOTE: What is considered real by a yogi is of no value for a worldly person and vice-versa.  \\nOne attains peace when all desires dissipate within the mind without creating any mental disturbance, just as river waters enter the full ocean without creating any disturbance. One who desires material objects is never peaceful. (2.70) One who abandons all desires, and becomes free from longing and the feeling of 'i' and 'my', attains peace. (2.71) O Arjuna, this is the superconscious state of mind. Attaining this state, one is no longer deluded. Gaining this state, even at the end of one's life, a person attains Nirvana (or becomes one with the Absolute). (2.72)\", 'Arjuna said: If  You  consider  acquiring  spiritual  knowledge  is better than working, then why do You want me to engage in this horrible war, O Krishna? You seem to confuse my mind by apparently conflicting words. Tell me, decisively, one thing by which I may attain the Supreme. (3.01-02) The Supreme Lord said: In this world,  O  Arjuna,  a  twofold  path  of  spiritual  discipline  has  been stated by Me in the past - the path of Self-knowledge for the contemplative, introverts and the path of unselfish work (Seva, Karmayoga) for all others. (3.03) One does not attain freedom from the bondage of Karma by merely abstaining from work. No one attains perfection by merely giving up work. (3.04) Because no one can remain actionless even for a moment, everyone is driven to action - helplessly indeed - by the forces of nature. (3.05) The deluded ones, who restrain their organs of action but mentally dwell upon the sense enjoyment, are called hypocrites. (3.06)  \\nWhy one should serve others?  \\nOne who controls the senses by a trained and purified mind and intellect, and engages the organs of action to selfless service, is superior, O Arjuna. (3.07) Perform your obligatory duty because working is indeed better than sitting idle. Even the maintenance of your body would be impossible without work. (3.08) Human beings are  bound  by  work  that  is  not  performed  as  a  selfless  service. Therefore, O Arjuna, becoming free from attachment to the fruits of work, do your duty efficiently as a service to Me. (3.09)', \"Brahma, the creator, in the beginning created human beings together with selfless service (Seva, sacrifice) and said: By Seva or sacrifice of self-interest you shall prosper, and Seva shall fulfill all your desires. (3.10) Help the celestial controllers (Devas) with selfless service and they will help you. Thus helping each other, you shall attain the Supreme goal of human life. (3.11) The celestial controllers, pleased by selfless service, will give you desired objects even without asking for it. One who enjoys the gift of celestials without offering them anything in return is, indeed, a thief. (3.12) The righteous who eat the remnants of selfless service are freed from all sins, but the impious who cook food only for themselves (without first offering to Me, or sharing with others), in truth, eat sin (3.13). The physical body of living beings is made up of and sustained by food;  food  is  created  by  God  from  five  basic  elements.  God  is pleased by the sacrifice (Qurbani) of self-interest: The selfless philanthropic work, and blesses selfless persons. Selfless work or sacrifice is our duty. Duty is prescribed in the scriptures. The scriptures come from God. Thus, the all-pervading God is ever present in selfless service, Seva. (3.14-15) One who does not help to keep the wheel of creation in motion by sacrificial duty and who rejoices sense pleasures only, that sinful person lives in vain, O Arjuna. (3.16) For a Self-realized person, who rejoices only with God, who is delighted with God and who is content with God, there is no duty. (3.17) Such a person has no interest, whatsoever, in what is done or what is not done. A Self-realized person does not depend on anybody, except God, for anything. (3.18)  \\nLeaders should set an example  \\nTherefore, always perform your duty efficiently and without any attachment to the results, because by doing work without attachment one attains the Supreme Being. (3.19) King Janaka and others  attained  perfection  (or  Self-realization)  by  selfless  service (Karma-yoga) alone. You should also perform your duty with a view to  guide  people,  and  for  universal  welfare  of  the  society.  (3.20) Whatever noble persons do, others follow. Whatever standard they set up, the world follows. (3.21) O Arjuna, there is nothing in the three worlds (heaven, earth, and the lower regions) that should be done by Me, nor there is anything that I should obtain, yet I engage in action. (3.22) If I do not engage in action relentlessly, O Arjuna, people would follow My path. These worlds would perish if I do not work, and I would be the cause of confusion and destruction of all these people. (3.23-24) As the ignorant work, O Arjuna, with attachment to the fruits of work, so the wise should work without attachment, for the welfare of the society. (3.25) The wise should not unsettle the minds of the ignorant, who are attached to the fruits of  \\nwork, but should inspire others by performing all works, efficiently, without attachment to results. (3.26)  \\nAll works are the works of Nature  \\nAll work is done by the energy and power of nature, but due to delusion of ignorance, people assume themselves to be the doer and thus incur sin or Karmic bondage. (3.27) One who knows the truth, O Arjuna, about the role of the forces of nature and work, does not become attached to work, knowing very well that it's the forces  of  nature  that  work  with  their  instruments  -  our  organs. (3.28) Those who are deluded by the illusive power (Maya) of Nature become attached to the work done by the forces of nature. The  wise  should  not  disturb  the  mind  of  the  ignorant  whose knowledge is imperfect. (3.29) Do your duty - dedicating all work to Me - in a spiritual frame of mind, free from desire, attachment, and mental grief. (3.30) Those who always practice this teaching of Mine - with faith, sincerity and free from complain - are freed from the bondage of Karma. But those who carp at My teaching and  do  not  practice  it,  should  be  considered  ignorant  of  all knowledge, senseless, and lost. (3.31-32) All beings follow their nature.  Even  the  wise  act  according  to  their  own  nature.  What, then, is the value of sense restraint? (3.33)  \\nTwo stumbling blocks on the path  \\nLikes and dislikes for sense objects remain in the senses. One should not come under the control of these two, because they are, indeed, two major stumbling blocks on one's path of Self-realization. (3.34) One's inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work. Death in carrying out one's natural work is useful. Unnatural work produces too much stress. (3.35)  \\nLust is the origin of sin  \\nArjuna said: O Krishna, what impels one to commit sin as if unwillingly and forced against one's will? (3.36) The Supreme Lord said: It  is  lust  (or  intense  desire  for  material  and  sensual  pleasures), born out of passion, that becomes anger when unfulfilled. Lust is insatiable and is a great devil. Know this as the enemy. (3.37) As the fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as an embryo by the amnion, similarly Self-knowledge becomes obscured by lust. (3.38) O Arjuna, Self-knowledge becomes covered by this insatiable fire of lust, the eternal enemy of the wise. (3.39) The senses, the mind, and the intellect are said to be the seat of lust. Lust - by controlling the senses, the mind, and the intellect - deludes a person by veiling Self-knowledge. (3.40) Therefore, O Arjuna, by controlling the senses first, kill this devil of material desire that destroys Self-knowledge and Self-realization. (3.41)  \\nHow to control lust  \\nThe senses are said to be superior to the body; the mind is superior to the senses; the intellect is superior to the mind; and  \\nSpirit is superior to the intellect. (3.42) Thus, knowing the Spirit to be superior to the intellect, and controlling the mind by the intellect that is purified by spiritual practices, one must kill this mighty enemy, lust, O Arjuna. (3.43)\", 'The Supreme Lord said: I taught this Karma-yoga, the eternal science of selfless action, to King Vivasvan. Vivasvan taught it to Manu. Manu taught it to Ikshvaku. Thus handed down in succession the saintly Kings knew this. After a long time the science of Karma-yoga was lost from this earth. Today I have described the same ancient science to you because you are my sincere devotee and friend. Karma-yoga is the supreme secret indeed. (4.01-03) Arjuna said: You were born later, but Vivasvan was born in ancient time. How am I to understand that You taught this Karma-yoga in the beginning of the creation? (4.04)', 'The  Supreme  Lord  said:  Both  you  and  I  have  taken  many births. I remember them all, O Arjuna, but you do not remember. (4.05) Though I am eternal, immutable, and the Lord of all beings, yet I manifest myself by controlling My own material Nature, using My divine potential energy (Maya). (4.06) Whenever there is a decline of Dharma (Righteousness) and a predominance of Adharma (or Unrighteousness), O Arjuna, then I manifest Myself. I appear from  time  to  time  for  protecting  the  good,  for  transforming  the wicked, and for establishing world order (Dharma). (4.07-08) The one who truly understands My transcendental appearance and activities  of  creation,  maintenance,  and  dissolution,  attains  My  supreme abode and is not born again after leaving this body, O Arjuna. (4.09) Many have become free from attachment, fear, anger, and attained salvation by taking refuge in Me, becoming fully absorbed in My thoughts, and becoming purified by the fire of Selfknowledge. (4.10)', 'With whatever motive people worship Me, I fulfill their desires accordingly.  People  worship  Me  with  different  motives.  (4.11) Those who long for success in their work here on the earth worship the celestial controllers. Success in work comes quickly in this human world. (4.12) The four divisions - based on aptitude and vocation - of human society were created by Me. Though I am the author of this system of the division of labor, one should know that I do nothing and I am eternal. (4.13) Work or Karma does not bind Me, because I have no desire for the fruits of work. The one who fully  understands  and  practices  this  truth  is  also  not  bound  by Karma.  (4.14)  The  ancient  seekers  of  liberation  also  performed  \\ntheir duties with this understanding. Therefore, you should do your duty as the ancients did. (4.15)', 'Even the wise ones are confused about what is action and what is inaction. Therefore, I shall clearly explain what is action, knowing that one shall be liberated from the evil of birth and death. (4.16) The true nature of action is very difficult to understand. Therefore, one should know the nature of attached or selfish action, the nature of detached or selfless action, and also the nature of forbidden action. (4.17)  \\nA Karma-yogi is not subject  to the Karmic laws  \\nThe one who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is a wise person. Such a person is a yogi and has accomplished everything. (4.18)  \\nTo see inaction in action and vice versa is to understand that the Lord does all the work indirectly through His power by using us. He is the inactive actor. We are actively inactive, because we cannot do anything without the flow of His power. Therefore, we are not the doer, just an instrument in His hands.  \\nA  person,  whose  desires  have  become  selfless  by  being roasted in the fire of Self-knowledge, is called a sage by the wise. (4.19)  The  one  who  has  abandoned  attachment  to  the  fruits  of work, and remains ever content and dependent on no one but God, such a person - though engaged in activity - does nothing at all and incurs no Karmic reaction, good or bad. (4.20) The one who is free from desires, whose mind and senses are under control, and who has renounced all proprietorship, does not incur sin  - the Karmic  reaction  -  by  doing  bodily  action.  (4.21)  Content  with whatever gain comes naturally by His will, unaffected by pairs of opposites, free from envy, calm in success and failure, though engaged in work, such a Karma-yogi is not bound by Karma. (4.22) The one who is free from attachment, whose mind is fixed in Selfknowledge, who does work as a service (Seva) to the Lord, all Karmic bonds of such a philanthropic person (Karma-yogi) dissolve away. (4.23) God shall be realized by the one who considers everything as a manifestation or an act of God. (Also see 9.16) (4.24)', 'Some yogis perform the service of worship to celestial controllers  (Devas,  guardian  angels),  while  others  study  scriptures  for Self-knowledge. Some restrain their senses and give up their sensual  pleasures.  Others  perform  breathing  and  other  yogic  exercises. Some give charity and offer their wealth as a sacrifice. (4.25-  \\n28) Those who are engaged in yogic practices, reach the breathless state of trance (Samadhi) by offering inhalation into exhalation and exhalation into inhalation as a sacrifice using yogic techniques. (4.29) Others restrict their diet and offer their inhalations as sacrifice into their inhalations. All these people are the knowers of sacrifice, and are purified by their sacrifice. (4.30) Those who perform selfless service obtain the nectar of Self-knowledge as a result of their  sacrifice  and  attain  the  Eternal  Being.  O  Arjuna,  even  this world is not a happy place for the non-sacrificer, how can the other world be? (4.31) Many types of spiritual disciplines are described in the Vedas. Know them all to be born from Karma or the action of body, mind, and senses. Knowing this, you shall attain Nirvana. (4.32)', 'The acquisition and propagation of Self-knowledge are superior to any material gain or gift, O Arjuna. Because all actions in their entirety culminate in knowledge. (4.33) Acquire this spiritual knowledge from a Self-realized guru by humble reverence, by sincere inquiry, and by service. The wise ones who have realized the Truth will teach you. (4.34) After knowing the Truth, O Arjuna, you shall not again become deluded like this. By this knowledge you shall behold the entire creation first within Me, the Supreme Being, then within your own higher self and then see Me alone in everything. (4.35) Even if one is the most sinful of all sinners, one shall yet cross over the ocean of sin by the raft of Self-knowledge. (4.36) As the blazing fire reduces wood to ashes; similarly, the fire of Selfknowledge reduces all bonds of Karma (or sin) to ashes, O Arjuna. (4.37)', 'In truth, there is no purifier in this world like the true knowledge of the Supreme Being. One who becomes purified by Karma-yoga discovers this knowledge within, naturally, in due course of time. (4.38) The one who has faith and is sincere in yogic practices and has control over the senses, gains this spiritual knowledge. Having gained this knowledge, one at once attains supreme peace. (4.39) The irrational, the faithless, and the atheist perish. There is neither this world, nor the world beyond, nor happiness for the disbeliever. (4.40)', 'Work (Karma) does not bind a person who has renounced work by renouncing attachment to the fruits of work, and whose doubts about the Self are completely destroyed by Self-knowledge, O Arjuna. (4.41) Therefore, cut the ignorance-born doubt about the Supreme Being abiding in your mind by the sword of Self-knowledge, resort to Karma-yoga, and get up for the war, O Arjuna. (4.42)', 'Arjuna  said:  O  Krishna,  You  praise  spiritual  knowledge  and also performance of selfless service. Tell me, definitely, which one is the better of the two. (5.01) The Supreme Lord said: The path of Self-knowledge and the path of selfless service both lead to the supreme goal. But, of the two, selfless service is superior to Selfknowledge. (5.02) A person should be considered a true Samnyasi (renunciant) who neither likes nor dislikes. One is easily liberated from Karmic bondage by becoming free from the pairs of opposites, O Arjuna. (5.03)', 'The  ignorant  -  not  the  wise  -  consider  the  path  of  Selfknowledge  (or  renunciation)  and  the  path  of  selfless  service (Karma-yoga) as different from each other. The person who has truly mastered one, gets the benefits of both. (5.04) Whatever goal a Samnyasi reaches, a Karma-yogi also reaches the same goal. Therefore, the one who sees the path of renunciation and the path of unselfish work as the same, really sees. (5.05) But, true renunciation, O Arjuna, is difficult to attain without Karma-yoga. A sage equipped with Karma-yoga quickly attains God. (5.06) A Karmayogi whose mind is pure, whose mind and senses are under control, and who sees one and the same Eternal Being in all beings, is not bound by Karma though intensely engaged in work. (5.07)', 'The wise (or Samnyasi) who knows the truth thinks: \"I do nothing at all\". In seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, breathing; and speaking, giving, taking, as well as opening and closing the eyes, a Samnyasi believes that only the senses are operating upon their objects. (5.08-09) One who does all work as an offering to the Lord - abandoning attachment to the results - remains untouched by Karmic reaction or sin as a lotus leaf never gets wet by water, while living in it. (5.10) The Karma-yogis perform action -without attachment - with their body, mind, intellect, and senses only for self-purification. (5.11) A Karma-yogi attains Supreme Bliss by abandoning attachment to the fruits of work; while others, who are attached to the fruits of work, become bound by selfish work. (5.12)', 'A  person  who  has  completely  renounced  attachment  to  the fruits of all works, lives happily, neither performing nor directing any action. (5.13) The Lord neither creates the urge for action, nor the feeling of doership, nor the attachment to the results of action in people. All these are done by the powers of Nature. (5.14) The Lord does not take the responsibility for the good or evil deeds of  \\nanybody. The Self-knowledge becomes covered by the veil of ignorance; thereby people become deluded and do evil deeds. (5.15) Spiritual knowledge destroys the ignorance of the Self and reveals the Supreme, just as the Sun reveals the beauty of objects of the world. (5.16) Persons whose mind and intellect are totally merged with the Source, who are firmly devoted to the Source, who have the Source as their supreme goal and sole refuge, and whose impurities are destroyed by the knowledge of the Source, do not take birth again. (5.17)', 'An enlightened person - by perceiving the Lord in all - looks at a learned and humble priest, an outcast, even a cow, an elephant, or a dog with an equal eye. (5.18) Everything has been accomplished in this very life by the one whose mind is set in equality. Such a person has realized God, because God is flawless and impartial. (5.19) One who neither rejoices on obtaining what is pleasant,  nor  grieves  on  obtaining  the  unpleasant,  who  has  a  steady mind, who is undeluded, and who is a knower of the Supreme Being, such a person eternally abides with the Supreme Being. (5.20) Such a person who is in union with the Supreme Being becomes unattached to sensual pleasures by discovering the joy of the Self through contemplation, and enjoys spiritual bliss. (5.21) Sensual pleasures are, in truth, the source of misery, and have a beginning and an end. Therefore, the wise do not rejoice sensual pleasures. (5.22) One who is able to withstand the impulse of lust and anger before death is a yogi, and a happy person. (5.23) One who finds happiness  with  the  Eternal  Being,  who  rejoices  Eternal  Being within, and who is illuminated by Self-knowledge; such a yogi attains Nirvana, and goes to Eternal Being. (5.24) Seers whose sins (or  imperfections)  are  destroyed,  whose  doubts  have  been  dispelled by Self-knowledge, whose minds are disciplined, and who are engaged in the welfare of all beings, attain the Supreme Being. (5.25) They, who are free from lust and anger, who have subdued the mind and senses, and who have known the Self, easily attain Nirvana. (5.26)', 'A sage is liberated by renouncing all material enjoyments, focusing the eyes and the mind between the eye-brows, equalizing the breath moving through the nostrils by using yogic techniques, keeping the senses, mind, and intellect under control, having salvation as the prime goal, and by becoming free from lust, anger, greed and fear. (5.27-28) My devotee attains peace by knowing Me, the Supreme Being as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, as the great Lord of all the universe, and the friend of all beings. (5.29)', 'The Supreme Lord said: One who performs the prescribed duty without seeking its fruit only for personal enjoyment, is a renunciant (Samnyasi) and a Karma-yogi. One does not become Samnyasi merely by not lighting the fire, and one does not become a yogi merely by abstaining from work. (6.01) O Arjuna, what they call renunciation (Samnyasa) is also known as Karma-yoga. No one becomes a Karma-yogi who has not renounced the selfish motive behind an action. (6.02)', 'For the wise who seeks to attain yoga of meditation or calmness of mind, Karma-yoga is said to be the means. For the one who has attained yoga, the calmness becomes the means of Selfrealization. A person is said to have attained yogic perfection when one has no desire for sensual pleasures or attachment to the fruits of work, and has renounced all selfish motives behind any action. (6.03-04)', \"One must elevate - and not degrade - oneself by one's own mind. The mind alone is one's friend as well as one's enemy. The mind is the friend of those who have control over it, and the same mind acts like an enemy for those who do not control it. (6.05-06) One who has control over the lower self - the mind and senses - is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor, and remains ever steadfast with the supreme Self. (6.07) A person is called yogi who has both Self-knowledge and Self-realization, who is calm, who has control over the mind and senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same. (6.08) A person is considered superior who is impartial towards companions, friends, enemies, neutrals, arbiters, haters, relatives, saints, and sinners. (6.09)\", 'A yogi, seated in solitude and alone, should constantly try to contemplate  the  Supreme  Being  after  bringing  the  mind  and senses under control, and becoming free from desires and proprietorship. (6.10) One should sit on his or her own firm seat that is neither too high nor too low, covered with dry grass, a deerskin, and a cloth, one over the other, in a clean spot. Sitting there in a comfortable position and concentrating the mind on God, controlling the thoughts and the activities of the senses, one should practice  meditation  for  self-purification.  (6.11-12)  One  should  sit  by holding the waist, spine, chest, neck, and head erect, motionless and steady; fix the eyes and the mind steadily in front of the nostrils, without looking around; make your mind serene and fearless; practice celibacy; have the mind under control; think of Me; and  \\nhave Me as the supreme goal. (6.13-14)  Thus, by always practicing to keep the mind fixed on Me, the yogi whose mind is subdued attains peace of Nirvana and comes to Me. (6.15)  \\nThis yoga is not possible, O Arjuna, for the one who eats too much or who does not eat at all; who sleeps too much or who keeps awake. (6.16) But for the one who is moderate in eating, recreation, working, sleeping, and waking, the yoga of meditation destroys all sorrow. (6.17) A person is said to have achieved yoga, the union with  the  Eternal  Being,  when  the  perfectly  disciplined  mind  becomes free from all desires and gets completely united with God in Samadhi (trance). (6.18) A lamp in a spot sheltered by the Eternal Being from the wind of desires does not flicker; this simile is used for the subdued mind of a yogi, practicing meditation on the Eternal Being. (6.19)  \\nWhen the mind, disciplined by the practice of meditation, becomes steady, one becomes content with the Eternal Being by beholding Him with purified intellect. (6.20) One feels infinite bliss that is perceivable only through the intellect and is beyond the reach of the senses. After realizing the Eternal Being, one is never separated from the Absolute Reality. (6.21) After Self-realization (SR), one does not regard any other gain superior to SR. Established in SR, one is not moved even by the greatest calamity. (6.22) The state of severance of union with sorrow is called yoga. This yoga should be practiced with firm determination and without any mental reservation. (6.23) One gradually attains tranquility of mind by totally  abandoning  all  selfish  desires,  completely  restraining  the senses from the sense objects by the intellect, keeping the mind fully absorbed in the Eternal Being by means of a well-trained and purified intellect, and thinking of Me. (6.24-25) Wheresoever this restless and unsteady mind wanders away during meditation, one should just witness it under the supervision of the Self. (6.26)', \"Supreme bliss comes to a Self-realized yogi, whose mind is tranquil, whose desires are under control, and who is free from sin (or faults). (6.27) Such a sinless yogi, who constantly engages his or her mind and intellect with the Eternal Being, easily enjoys the infinite bliss of contact with God. (6.28) Because of perceiving the omnipresent  Eternal  Being  abiding  in  all  beings,  and  all  beings abiding in the Eternal Being; a yogi, who is in union with the Eternal Being, sees every being with an equal eye. (6.29) Those who perceive Me in everything and behold everything in Me, are not separated from Me, and I am not separated from them. (6.30) The nondualists, who adore Me as abiding in all beings, abide in Me irrespective of their mode of living. (6.31) One is considered the best yogi who regards every being like oneself and who can feel the pain and pleasures of others as one's own, O Arjuna. (6.32)\", 'Arjuna said: O Krishna, You have said that the yoga of meditation is characterized by the calmness of mind, but due to restlessness of mind, I do not perceive the steady state of mind. Because the mind, indeed, is very unsteady, turbulent, powerful, and obstinate, O Krishna. I think restraining the mind is as difficult as restraining the wind. (6.33-34) The Supreme Lord said: Undoubtedly, O Arjuna, the mind is restless and difficult to restrain, but it is subdued  by  constant  vigorous  spiritual  practice  with  perseverance, Self-knowledge and detachment, O Arjuna. (6.35) In My opinion, yoga is difficult for the one whose mind is not subdued. However, yoga  is  attainable  by  the  person  of  subdued  mind  by  striving through proper means. (6.36)', 'Arjuna said: The faithful who deviates from the path of meditation and fails to attain yogic perfection due to unsubdued mind what is the destination of such a person, O Krishna? (6.37) Does he not perish like a dispersing cloud, O Krishna, having lost both worldly and heavenly pleasures; supportless and bewildered on the path of Self-realization? (6.38) O Krishna, only You are able to completely dispel this doubt of mine because there is none, other than  You,  who  can  dispel  this  doubt.  (6.39)  The  Supreme  Lord said: There is no destruction, O Arjuna, for a yogi either here or hereafter. A spiritualist is never put to grief, My dear friend. (6.40)  \\nThe unsuccessful yogi is reborn in the house of the pious and prosperous after attaining heaven and living there for many years, or such a yogi is born in a family of enlightened yogis. A birth like this is very difficult, indeed, to obtain in this world. (6.41-42) There a  yogi  regains  the  knowledge  acquired  in  the  previous  life  and strives again to achieve perfection, O Arjuna. (6.43)  The unsuccessful yogi is instinctively carried towards the Eternal Being by virtue of the impressions (Samskara) of yogic practices of previous lives. Even the inquirer of yoga - the union with God - surpasses those  who  perform  Vedic  rituals.  (6.44)  The  yogi  who  diligently strives, becomes completely free from all sins or imperfections after  gradually perfecting through many incarnations, and reaches the Supreme Abode. (6.45)', \"The yogi is superior to the ascetics. The yogi is superior to the scholars. The yogi is superior to the ritualists. Therefore, O Arjuna, be a yogi. (6.46) I consider the yogi-devotee - who lovingly contemplates  Me  with  supreme  faith,  and  whose  mind  is  ever  absorbed in Me - to be the best of all the yogis. (6.47)  \\nThe Supreme Lord said: O Arjuna, listen how you shall know Me fully without any doubt, with your mind absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, and performing yogic practices. (7.01) I shall impart you  Self-knowledge,  together  with  enlightenment,  after  comprehending that nothing more remains to be known in this world. (7.02) Scarcely one out of thousands of persons strives for perfection of Self-realization.  Scarcely  one  among  those  successful  strivers truly understands Me. (7.03)  \\nDefinitions of matter, consciousness, and spirit  \\nThe mind, intellect, ego, ether, air, fire, water, and earth are the eightfold transformation (or division) of My material energy (Prakriti).  (7.04)  The  material  energy  is  My  lower  Nature.  My  other higher Nature is Spirit (Purusha) by which this entire universe is sustained, O Arjuna. (7.05) Know that all creatures have evolved from this twofold energy; and I, the Supreme Being, am the source of origin, as well as dissolution of the entire universe. (7.06)  \\nThe Supreme spirit is the basis of everything  \\nThere is nothing higher than Me, O Arjuna. Everything in the universe is strung on Me like jewels are strung on the thread of a necklace. (7.07) O Arjuna, I am the sapidity in the water, I am the radiance in the sun and the moon, the sacred syllable 'OM' in all the Vedas, the sound in the ether, and potency in human beings. I am the sweet fragrance in the earth. I am the heat in the fire, the life in all living beings, and the austerity in the ascetics. (7.08-09) O Arjuna, know Me to be the eternal seed of all creatures. I am the intelligence of the intelligent and the brilliance of the brilliant. I am the strength of the strong that is devoid of lust and attachment. I am lust (Cupid) in human beings that is in accord with righteousness (Dharma) for the sacred and sole purpose of procreation after marriage, O Arjuna. (7.10-11) Know that three modes (Gunas) of Nature - goodness, passion, and ignorance - also emanate from Me. I am not dependent on or affected by the Gunas, but the Gunas are dependent on Me. (7.12) Human beings are deluded by the various aspects of these three Gunas of Nature; therefore, they do not know Me, who is eternal and above these Gunas. (7.13)  \\nWho seeks God?  \\nThis divine power (Maya) of Mine, consisting of three modes (Gunas) of Nature, is very difficult to overcome. Only those who surrender unto Me can easily cross over this Maya. (7.14) The evil doers, the ignorant, the lowest persons who are attached to demonic nature and whose power of discrimination has been taken away by divine illusive power (Maya) do not worship or seek Me. (7.15)  \\nFour types of virtuous ones worship or seek Me, O Arjuna. They are: The distressed, the seeker of Self-knowledge, the seeker of  \\nwealth,  and  the  enlightened  one  who  has  experienced  the  Supreme. (7.16) Among them the enlightened devotee, who is ever united with Me and whose devotion is single-minded, is the best, because I am very dear to the enlightened, and the enlightened is also very dear to Me. (7.17) All these seekers are indeed noble, but I regard the enlightened devotee as My very Self. One who is steadfast becomes one with Me and abides in My supreme abode. (7.18) After many births the enlightened one resorts to Me by realizing  that  everything  is,  indeed,  My  manifestation.  Such  a  great soul is very rare. (7.19) Persons whose judgement has been carried away by various desires, impelled by their Karmic impression (Samskara), resort to celestial controllers and practice various religious rites. (7.20)  \\nGod can be seen in any image of worship  \\nWhosoever  desires  to  worship  whatever  deity  (using  any name, form, and method) with faith, I make their faith steady in that very deity. Endowed with steady faith, they worship that deity and fulfil  their  wishes  through  that  deity.  Those  wishes  are,  indeed, granted only by Me. (7.21-22) Such material gains of these less intelligent human beings are temporary. The worshipers of celestial controllers go to celestial controllers, but My devotees certainly come to Me. (7.23)  \\nThe ignorant ones - unable to understand My immutable, incomparable, incomprehensible and transcendental form, assume that I am formless and take form just as humans do. (7.24) Concealed by My divine power (Maya), I do not reveal Myself to the ignorant ones, who do not know and understand My unborn, eternal, transcendental form and personality - and consider Me formless! (7.25)  \\nI  know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, of the present, and those of the future, but no one really knows Me. (7.26) All beings in this world are in utter ignorance due to delusion of pairs of opposites born of likes and dislikes, O Arjuna. But persons of unselfish deeds, whose Karma or sin has come to an end, become free from the delusion of pairs of opposites and worship Me with firm resolve. (7.27-28) Those who strive for freedom from the cycles of birth, old age, and death by taking refuge in Me; fully comprehend Eternal Being, the nature of Eternal Being, and Karma, the power of Eternal Being. (7.29) The steadfast persons who know Me as everything: The mortal beings, temporal Divine Beings, the Supersoul, even at the time of death, attain Me. (7.30)\", 'Arjuna said: O Krishna, who is the Eternal Being? What is the nature of the Eternal Being? What is Karma? Who are the mortal  \\nbeings? And who are Divine Beings? Who is the Supersoul, and how does He dwell in the body? How can You be remembered at the time of death by those who have control over their minds, O Krishna? (8.01-02)  \\nDefinitions of supreme spirit, spirit, individual soul  \\nThe Supreme Lord said: The immutable Spirit is called Eternal Being or God. The nature, including the inherent power of cognition and desire, of God is called Adhyatma. The creative power of God that causes manifestation of living entities is called Karma. (8.03) Mortal beings are called Adhibhuta. The expansions of Divine Personality are called Divine Beings. I am the Supersoul residing inside every cell of living beings as the supreme controller, O Arjuna. (8.04)', 'The one who remembers Me exclusively, even while leaving the body at the time of death, attains Me; there is no doubt about it. (8.05) Remembering whatever object one leaves the body at the end of life, one attains that object, O Arjuna. Because of the constant thought of that object, one remembers that object at the end of life and achieves it. (8.06)  \\nA simple method of God-realization  \\nTherefore, always remember Me and do your duty. You shall certainly attain Me if your mind and intellect are ever focused on Me. (8.07) By contemplating on Me with an unwavering mind that is  disciplined  by  the  practice  of  meditation,  one  attains  the  Supreme Being, O Arjuna. (8.08) One who meditates on the Supreme Being - as the omniscient, the oldest, the controller, smaller than the smallest and bigger than the biggest, sustainer of everything, the inconceivable, self-luminous like the sun, and beyond material reality - at the time of death with steadfast mind and devotion; making the flow of bioimpulses (life forces, Prana) rise up to the middle of two eye brows (or the sixth Chakra) by the power of yoga and holding there, attains the Supreme Divine Person. (8.09-10) I shall briefly explain the process to attain the supreme abode that the knowers of the Veda call immutable; into which the ascetics, freed from attachment, enter; and desiring which, people lead a life of celibacy. (8.11)', 'When  one  leaves  the  physical  body  by  controlling  all  the senses,  focusing  the  mind  on  God,  engaged  in  yogic  practice, meditating  on  Me  and  uttering  OM  -  the  sacred  monosyllable sound power of Eternal Being - one attains the supreme abode. (8.12-13) I am easily attainable, O Arjuna, by that ever steadfast yogi who always thinks of e and whose mind does not go elsewhere. (8.14) After attaining Me, the great souls do not incur rebirth in this miserable transitory world because they have attained the  \\nhighest perfection. (8.15) The dwellers of all the worlds - up to and including the world of Brahma, the creator - are subject to the miseries of repeated birth and death. But, after attaining Me, O Arjuna, one does not take birth again. (8.16)', \"Those who know that the day of the creator (Brahma) lasts one thousand Yugas (or 4.32 billion solar years) and that his night also lasts one thousand Yugas, they are the knowers of day and night. (8.17) All manifestations come out of the primary material Nature (Adi-Prakriti)  at  the  arrival  of  the  day  of  Brahma,  the  Creative Power,  and  they  again  merge  into  the  same  at  the  coming  of Brahma's night. (8.18) The same multitude of beings comes into existence again and again at the arrival of the day of the creator (Brahma); and are annihilated, inevitably, at the arrival of Brahma's night. (8.19)  \\nThere is another eternal existence - higher than the changeable material Nature (Prakriti) - that does not perish when all created beings perish. This is called the Eternal Being. This is also said  to  be  the  supreme  abode.  Those  who  attain  My  supreme abode do not take birth again. (8.20-21) This supreme abode, O Arjuna, is attainable by unswerving devotion to Me, within which all beings exist and by which all this universe is pervaded. (8.22)\", \"O  Arjuna,  now  I  shall  describe  different  paths  departing  by which, after death, the yogis do or do not come back. (8.23) Passing gradually, after death, through celestial controllers of fire, light, daytime, the bright lunar fortnight, and the six months of the northern solstice of the sun, yogis who know the Self attain supreme abode and do not come back to earth. (8.24) Passing gradually, after death, through celestial controllers of smoke, night, the dark lunar fortnight, and the six months of southern solstice of the sun, the  righteous  person  attains  heaven  and  comes  back  to  earth again. (8.25) The path of light of Self-knowledge and the path of darkness of ignorance are thought to be the world's two eternal paths. The former leads to salvation (Mukti, Nirvana), and the latter leads to rebirth. (8.26)\", 'Knowing these two paths, O Arjuna, a yogi is not bewildered at all. Therefore, O Arjuna, be steadfast in yoga (union) with Me at all times. (8.27) The yogi who knows all this goes beyond getting the benefits of the study of the Vedas, performance of sacrifices, austerities,  and  charities,  and  attains  My  Supreme  Eternal  Abode. (8.28)', 'The Supreme Lord said: I shall reveal to you, who do not disbelieve, the most profound, secret, spiritual knowledge, together with spiritual experience. Knowing this, you will be freed from the miseries of worldly existence. (9.01)', \"This Self-knowledge is the king of all knowledge, is the most secret, is very sacred, can be perceived by instinct, conforms to righteousness (Dharma), is very easy to practice, and is timeless. (9.02) O Arjuna, those who have no faith in this knowledge do not attain Me and follow the cycles of birth and death. (9.03) This entire universe is an expansion of Mine. All beings depend on Me. I do not depend on them, because I am the highest of all. (9.04) Look at the power of My divine mystery; in reality, I - the sustainer and creator of all beings - do not depend on them, and they also do not depend on Me. (9.05)  \\nNOTE: It's like a gold-chain depends on gold, and milk products depend on milk. In fact, the gold-chain does not depend on gold; the chain is nothing but gold! Similarly, matter and energy are different as well as non-different.  \\nPerceive that all beings remain in Me, without any connection or contact, as the mighty wind, moving everywhere in the sky, eternally remains in space.

(9.07) I create the entire multitude of beings again and again with the help of My material Nature. These beings are under control of the three modes of material Nature. (9.08) These acts of creation do not bind Me, O Arjuna, because I remain indifferent and unattached to those acts. (9.09) The divine kinetic energy (Maya) - with the help of material Nature - creates all animate and inanimate objects under My supervision; thus, the creation keeps on going, O Arjuna. (9.10)', 'Ignorant persons hate Me when I appear in human form because they do not know My spiritual nature as the great Lord of all beings and take Me for an ordinary human. They have false hopes, false actions, false knowledge, and delusive qualities (See 16.0418) of fiends and demons and are unable to recognize Me. (9.1112) But great souls, O Arjuna, who possess divine qualities (See 16.01-03), know Me as immutable, as both the material and efficient cause of creation, and worship Me single-mindedly with loving devotion. (9.13) Persons of firm resolve worship Me with ever  \\nsteadfast devotion by always singing My glories, striving to attain Me, and prostrating before Me with devotion. (9.14) Some worship Me by acquiring and propagating Self-knowledge. Others worship the infinite as the One in all (or non-dual), as the master of all (or dual), and in various other ways.

(9.30)  \\nThere  are  no  unforgivable  sins  or  sinners.  The  fire  of sincere repentance burns all sins.  \\nSuch a person soon becomes righteous and attains everlasting peace.

(9.32) It should then be very easy for holy priests and devout sages to attain the Supreme. Therefore, having obtained this joyless and transitory human life, one should always worship Me with loving devotion. (9.33) Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, worship Me, and bow down to Me. Thus, uniting yourself with Me by setting Me as the supreme goal and the sole refuge, you shall certainly come to Me.

(11.36) Why should they not - O great soul - bow to You, the original creator who is even greater than Brahma, the creator of material worlds?

(11.53) However, through single-minded devotion alone, I can be seen in this form, can be known in essence, and also  can  be  reached,  O  Arjuna.

(12.02) They also attain Me who worship the unchangeable, the inexplicable, the invisible, the omnipresent, the inconceivable, the unchanging, and the immovable Eternal Being; restraining all the senses, even minded under all circumstances, and engaged in the welfare of all creatures. (12.03-04)  \\nReasons for worshipping a personal God  \\nSelf-realization is more difficult for those who fix their mind on the  impersonal,  unmanifest,  Eternal  Being  because  comprehension of the unmanifest by human beings is attained with difficulty.

(12.09)  If  you  are unable even to do any spiritual discipline, then be intent on performing  all  your  duty  for  Me.  You  shall  attain  perfection  just  by working for Me as an instrument, just to serve and please Me, without selfish motives. (12.10) If you are unable to work for Me, then just  surrender unto My will and renounce the attachment to and anxiety for the fruits of all work with subdued mind - by learning to accept all results, as God's grace.

(13.14) He is inside as well as outside all beings, animate and inanimate. He is incomprehensible because of His subtlety. And because of His omnipresence, He is very near, residing in one's inner psyche, as well as far away in His Supreme Abode. (13.15) He is undivided, and yet appears to exist as if divided in beings.

Purusha (Consciousness, Spirit) is said to be the cause of experiencing pleasure and pain. (13.1920) Purusha enjoys three modes of material Nature (Prakriti) by associating  with  Prakriti.

(13.28) One who perceives that all works are done by the powers (Gunas) of material Nature (Prakriti) alone, and thus does not consider  oneself  as  the  doer,  that  person  truly  understands.

(14.06) Know that the mode of passion is characterized  by  intense  craving  and  is  the source of desire and attachment. It binds the living entity by attachment to the fruits of work. (14.07) Know, O Arjuna, that the mode of ignorance - the deluder of living entity - is born of inertia. It binds  the  living  entity  by  carelessness,  laziness,  and  excessive sleep. (14.08) O Arjuna, the mode of goodness attaches one to happiness (of learning and knowing the Eternal Being); the mode of passion attaches to intense action; and the mode of ignorance attaches to inaction, laziness by covering Self-knowledge.

(14.11) O Arjuna, when passion is predominant, greed, activity, undertaking  of  selfish  work,  restlessness,  excitement,  etc.  arise. (14.12) O Arjuna, when inertia is predominant, ignorance, inactivity, carelessness, delusion, etc. arise. (14.13)', 'One who dies when goodness dominates goes to heaven the pure world of knowers of the Supreme. (14.14) One who dies when passion dominates is reborn attached to action or the utilitarian type. One who dies in ignorance is reborn as a lower creature. (14.15) The fruit of good action is said to be beneficial and pure; the fruit of passionate action is pain; and the fruit of ignorant action is laziness. (14.16) Self-knowledge arises from the mode of goodness; greed arises from the mode of passion; and negligence, delusion, and slowness of mind arise from the mode of ignorance. (14.17) They who are established in goodness go to heaven; passionate persons are reborn in the mortal world; and the ignorant, abiding in the lowest mode of ignorance, go to lower planets or hell (or take birth as lower creatures). (14.18)', 'When visionaries perceive no doer other than the three modes of material Nature and know the Supreme, which is above and beyond these modes, then they attain salvation (Mukti). (14.19) When one rises above the three modes of material Nature that originate in the body, one attains immortality or salvation (Mukti) and is freed from the pains of birth, old age, and death.

One who understands this tree is a knower of the Vedas. (15.01) The branches of this cosmic tree of Maya (Illusion) spread all over the cosmos. The tree is nourished by three modes of material Nature; sense pleasures are its sprouts; and its roots of ego, attachment and desire stretch below in the human world, causing Karmic bondage. (15.02)', 'The real form of this tree is not perceptible here on earth, nor is its beginning, end, or existence. Having cut the firm roots - the ego and desires - of this tree by the mighty ax of Self-knowledge and detachment; thus thinking: \"I take refuge in that very primal person from whom this primal manifestation  comes forth\",  seek that supreme abode from where one does not come back to the mortal world again. (15.03-04) The wise reach that eternal goal, who are free from pride and delusion, who have conquered the evil of attachment, who constantly dwell in the Supreme Self with all desires completely stilled, and who are free from dualities of pleasure  and  pain.

But those who have the eye of Self-knowledge can see it.

They have neither purity nor good conduct nor truthfulness. (16.07) They say that the world is unreal, without a substratum, without God, and without an order. The world is caused by sexual union of man and woman alone and nothing else. (16.08) Adhering to this wrong, atheistic view, these degraded souls - with small intellect and cruel deeds - are born as enemies for the destruction of the world. (16.09) Filled with insatiable desires, hypocrisy, pride, and arrogance; holding wrong views due to delusion; they act with impure motives, (16.10) obsessed with endless anxiety lasting until death, considering sense gratification their highest aim, and convinced that sense pleasure is everything; (16.11)  \\nBound by hundreds of ties of desire and enslaved by lust and anger, they strive to obtain wealth by unlawful means to fulfill sensual pleasures. They think: (16.12) This has been gained by me today; I shall fulfill this desire; I have this much wealth and will have more wealth in the future; (16.13) that enemy has been slain by me, and I shall slay others also. I am the lord. I am the enjoyer. I am successful, powerful, and happy; (16.14)  \\nI am rich and born in a noble family. Who is equal to me? I shall perform sacrifice, I shall give charity, and I shall rejoice.

One can become whatever one wants to be - if one constantly contemplates the object of desire with faith. (17.03) Persons in the mode of goodness worship celestial controllers; those in the mode of passion worship supernatural rulers and demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits.

(18.03)  \\nO Arjuna, listen to My conclusion about sacrifice. Sacrifice is said to be of three types. (18.04) Acts of service, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned, but should be performed, because service, charity, and austerity are the purifiers of the wise. (18.05) Even these obligatory works should be performed without attachment to the fruits. This is My definite supreme advice, O Arjuna. (18.06)', \"Giving up one's duty is not proper. The abandonment of obligatory work is due to delusion and is declared to be in the mode of ignorance. (18.07) One who abandons duty merely because it is difficult or because of fear of bodily affliction, does not get the benefits of sacrifice by performing such a sacrifice in the mode of passion.  (18.08)  Obligatory work performed as duty, renouncing attachment to the fruit, is alone to be regarded as sacrifice in the mode of goodness, O Arjuna. (18.09) One who neither hates a disagreeable work, nor is attached to an agreeable work, is considered a sacrificer (Tyagi), imbued with the mode of goodness, intelligent, and free from all doubts about the Supreme Being. (18.10) Human beings cannot completely abstain from work. Therefore,  \\none who completely renounces attachment to the fruits of all work is considered a Tyagi.

They are: the physical body, the seat of Karma; the modes of material Nature, the doer; the eleven organs of perception and action, the instruments; various life forces; and the fifth is one's fate. (18.13-14) These  are  the  five  causes  of  whatever  action,  whether  right  or wrong, one performs by thought, word and deed. (18.15) Therefore, the ignorant, who consider one's body or the soul as the sole agent, do not understand due to imperfect knowledge. (18.16) One who is free from the notion of doership and whose intellect is not polluted by the desire to reap the fruit - even after slaying all these people - neither slays nor is bound by the act of killing. (18.17) The subject, the object, and the knowledge of the object are the threefold driving force (or impetus) to an action.

(18.20) The knowledge by which one sees different realities of various types among all beings as separate from one another; such knowledge is in the mode of passion.

(18.30) That intellect is in the mode of passion which cannot distinguish between righteousness and unrighteousness, and right and wrong action, O Arjuna.

(18.37) Sensual pleasures that appear as nectars in the beginning, but become poison in the end, are in the mode of passion. (18.38) Pleasure that confuses a person in the beginning and in the end as a result of sleep,  laziness,  and  carelessness,  is  in  the  mode  of  ignorance.

(18.46) One\\'s inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work even though well performed. One who does the work ordained by one\\'s inherent nature without selfish  motives  incurs  no  sin  or  Karmic  bondage.  (18.47)  One\\'s natural work, even though defective, should not be abandoned because all undertakings are enveloped by defects as fire is covered by smoke, O Arjuna. (18.48) The person whose mind is always free from attachment, who has subdued the mind and senses, and who is  free  from  desires,  attains  the  supreme  perfection  of  freedom from the bondage of Karma by renouncing attachment to the fruits of work. (18.49)  \\nLearn from Me briefly, O Arjuna, how one who has attained such perfection - the freedom from the bondage of Karma - attains the Supreme Person, the goal of spiritual knowledge. (18.50) Endowed with purified intellect, subduing the mind with firm resolve, turning away from sound and other objects of the senses, giving up likes and dislikes; living in solitude; eating lightly; controlling the mind, speech, and organs of action; ever absorbed in yoga of meditation; taking refuge in detachment; and relinquishing egotism, violence,  pride,  lust,  anger,  and  proprietorship  -  one  becomes peaceful, free from the notion of \"I\\' and \\'my\", and fit for attaining oneness with the Supreme Being. (18.51-53) Absorbed in the Supreme Being, the serene one neither grieves nor desires. Becoming impartial to all beings, one obtains My Para-Bhakti, the highest devotional love. (18.54) By devotion one truly understands what and who I am in essence. Having known Me in essence, one immediately merges with Me. (18.55)  \\nA Karma-yogi attains the eternal immutable abode, by My grace - even while doing all duties - just by dedicating all action to Me with loving devotion. (18.56) Sincerely offer all actions to Me, set Me as your supreme goal, and completely depend on Me. Always fix your mind on Me and resort to Karma-yoga. (18.57) When your mind becomes fixed on Me, you shall overcome all difficulties by My grace. But, if you do not listen to Me due to ego, you shall perish. (18.58)  \\nIf  due to ego you think: I shall not fight, your resolve is vain. Because your own nature will compel you to fight. (18.59) O Arjuna, you are controlled by your own nature-born Karmic impressions (or Samskara). Therefore, you shall do - even against your will - what you do not wish to do out of delusion. (18.60) The Supreme Lord, Krishna or God, abiding as the controller in the inner psyche of all beings, O Arjuna, causes them to evolve - or work out their Karma - like a puppet of Karma, mounted on a machine. (18.61)  \\nThe Supreme Controller is the reflection of the Supreme Spirit in the body. The  Supreme  Lord  organizes, controls, supervises, and directs everything in the universe. Human being is like a puppet of Karma mounted on a body which is the vehicle of transmigration. The word evolve refers to working out one\\'s Karma. Thus we become the puppet of our own Karma created by our free will.  \\nThe  Lord  has  made  Karmic  laws  as  the  controller  of  all living beings. Therefore, one must learn to gladly endure all that fate imposes by taking refuge in God and following His commandments. Vedas declare  that  the  Lord,  using  His  law  of Karma,  makes  us  dance  as  a  juggler  would  make  his  monkey dance.  Without  the  laws  of  Karma;  the  scriptural  injunctions, prohibitions,  as  well  as  self-effort,  would  have  no  value  at  all. Karma is the eternal justice and the eternal law. As a result of the working of eternal justice, there can be no escape from the consequences of our deeds. We become the product of our own past thinking and action. Therefore, we must think and act wisely at the present moment, using the scriptures as a guide.  \\nThe doctrine of Karma and reincarnation is also found in the following two verses of the Koran: Allah is He who created you and then sustained you, then causes you to die, then gives life to you again (Surah 30.40). He may reward those who believe and do good works. No one is able to escape His law of consequences (Surah 30.45). People cannot escape from the consequences of their deeds, for as we sow, so we reap. Cause and effect cannot be separated because the effect exists in the cause as the fruit exists in the seed. Good and evil deeds follow us continually like our shadows.  \\nThe Bible also says: Whosoever shedeth man\\'s blood, by man shall his blood be shed (Genesis 9.06). It is believed that all references to Karma and reincarnation were taken out of the Bible during  the  second  century  with  the  noble  aim  of  encouraging people to strive hard for perfection during this very life. Those who believe in reincarnation must avoid laziness and procrastination, stress  intense  spiritual  discipline,  and  try  their  best  to  get  Self-  \\nrealization in this very life as if there were no reincarnation. Live as though  this  is  your  last  day  on  this  earth.  One  cannot  achieve anything through laziness and procrastination.  \\nSeek refuge in the Supreme Lord alone with loving devotion, O Arjuna. By His grace you shall attain supreme peace and the Eternal Abode. (18.62) Thus, I have explained the knowledge that is more secret than the secret. After fully reflecting on this, do as you wish. (18.63)', 'Hear once again My most secret, supreme word. You are very dear to Me; therefore, I shall tell this for your benefit. (18.64) Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer service to Me, bow down to Me, and you shall certainly reach Me. I promise you, because you are My very dear friend. (18.65) Setting aside doership, ownership and attachment to the fruits of all works, just surrender toor gladly abide by- My Will. I shall liberate you from all sins or bondage of Karma. Do not grieve. (18.66)  \\nThe meaning of abandoning all duties and taking refuge in God is that one should perform duty without ego and attachment to results; as an offering to the Lord, and totally depend only on Him. The Lord takes full responsibility for a person who totally depends on Him and understands: All is manifestation of the One.', \"This knowledge should never be spoken by you to one who is devoid of austerity, who is without devotion, who does not desire to listen, or  who speaks ill of Me. (18.67)  \\nTo speak of wisdom to a deluded person, to glorify sacrifice to a greedy person, to advise sense control to an irascible person, and to discourse on Lord Rama's exploits to a lecher, is as useless as sowing seed on barren ground. It is not for any soul to believe, save by the permission of Allah. You should not compel one to believe  (Surah  10.100-101).  Anyone  to  whom  Allah  has  not granted the light (of knowledge) will have no light (Surah 24.40). The study of Gita or any other scripture is meant only for sincere persons. According to Ramakrishna, one can understand Him as much as He makes one understand.

      "The mind, when controlled by roving senses, steals away the intellect as a storm takes away a boat on the sea from its destination - the spiritual shore. (2.67) Therefore, O Arjuna, one's intellect becomes steady when the senses are completely withdrawn from its sense objects. (2.68) A yogi, the person of self-restraint, remains wakeful when it is night for all others. It is night for a yogi who sees when all others are wakeful. (2.69)  \n",

One who desires material objects is never peaceful. (2.70) One who abandons all desires, and becomes free from longing and the feeling of 'i' and 'my', attains peace. (2.71) O Arjuna, this is the superconscious state of mind. Attaining this state, one is no longer deluded.

(2.61) One develops attachment to sense objects by thinking about sense objects. Desire for sense objects comes from attachment to sense objects, and anger comes from unfulfilled desires.

(6.05-06) One who has control over the lower self - the mind and senses - is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor, and remains ever steadfast with the supreme Self. (6.07) A person is called yogi who has both Self-knowledge and Self-realization, who is calm, who has control over the mind and senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.
