That can be out. It's patch-corner efficient. Maybe both can do. But this one, this one especially, it's quite... I don't think patch-corner can do this. But that's actually really good. I'm not sure because it comes in logically and patch code is valid This one is simple, I'm not sure about this one I think the problem is that the model wouldn't output, it's not parallel It would would output like this thing here, it has not the correct shape or something like that. But, as I said, I don't see how we could just check for parallelism. Like, definitely not the detection model but something like YOLO or something, or just like line detection. Yeah, exactly'm sorry. But yeah, we have to create a model for that.\n",

      "(230.64, 232.64)--> our own artificial images,\n",
      "(232.64, 293.96)--> our own images at night, or we manipulate the type of the map. So for me, what interests me is to know the number of cameras that are necessary to control the entire element, because we can see that there are controls, we have to visualize the map with its globality to check the general state, and we have to control the plan. And indeed, with these controls, we have to more or less look for the resolution at the moment. And I'm interested in doing this work to see the feasibility, we will answer to the feasibility, but also to use the structural structure of the roof, with the use of the\n",
      "(293.96, 280.0)-->\n",
      "(284.0, 287.0)--> That's it, that's the goal of this meeting.\n",
      "(289.0, 292.0)--> And then, because the skin is joined.\n",
      "(567.0, 565.0)--> So, on the board, we can see that I added all the controls, the parameters, the faces that will be controlled compared to the control class, imagine, I will add a camera, which allows me to take the number of cameras necessary, whether to have a global view or only to put them on the elements. There are surely cameras that will be mutualized, especially for the case of the label, to read what is marked. We could use the same camera to control the connectors just by turning the card. there will also be this logic of mutualization by turning the CTE card so I'm going to shake a little this control so here the state generates components, the identification of components, so for me at least a component less than missing components it's clear So we agree that on the global view and the map, we are talking about this view with the absence of any element, but with a global view. Yes, in fact, if you want, I did it less than the operator. The operator does that. After, in the view, I think that the software, why do you want things like that? Yes, but it's already that. In fact, if you want, your image in black and white, for me, all the components are well aligned. Imagine that you find a map that is like that, I can't tell you, problem with the detector. Ok, so a little hard to move, a bigger component, a small map, a small map, etc. Move, then we have a general view. We go to the denominator of this general view, and we detect that there is something that is a bit different from what we have defined as nominal. Yes, a comparison. We are looking at the absence of alignment, lack of hardness, ok, that's clear. For me, there will be a camera that will control the length of the map, to visualize the components. I imagine that it will be the same photo that we will use to check if there is no broken component in the beginning. So there we talk about intact corners. In fact, here, for example, it is the corner of a plastic limper. But it can also be a very hard piece of wood. In fact, in the case of Aluf, you have to use aluminum pieces. All that concerns the wood, it's a bit off, because we don't really look at the wood. So the wood is really the wood of the wood. Ok, the SN, the amendment, the codebar, the comparison. So this image, I have a good image, I tried the black circle. We managed to read it, but it also concerns the fact that the label is a female and the operator comes with the middle finger it's what they lie I did the course with the staff and the impression is that we can move it we can already draw the image and we can't see it anymore as soon as it's visible, it's gone I had a question about this What is the amendment? I imagine that the amendment must be A, B, C or whatever That is. That's right. What is the level in this ticket? We can't see it, it's next to me. In my presentation... We have to find the letter, no question. Yes, that's it. The letter should be found. Ok, it's like a moron. No, that's it. But on this image, we did it, it's not there.\n",
      "(565.0, 568.0)--> It's on the side.\n",
      "(568.0, 571.0)--> And it's a circle, what does that mean?\n",
      "(571.0, 574.0)--> No, that's a mark.\n",
      "(574.0, 577.0)--> That's the signature of the foreman.\n",
      "(577.0, 580.0)--> It's not really a lot of math, it's a lot of fault.\n",
      "(580.0, 582.0)--> Yes, there are two, especially David.\n",
      "(582.0, 686.0)--> It's not a lot of mistakes. Yes, there are two, especially David. It's the supplier that marks the mark. Ok, because the mount will not read it. It will be a classification. Basically, I don't know what I can do. Basically, what we're going to do is that, for example, imagine that I'm going around A. In fact, I'm going to create a classification model with a couple of images in the same class as the A, and I'm going to call it A. The second class is called B, and I'm going to call it A. I'm not going to read it because the R won't allow the difference, but I'm going to classify each image to give the amendment. Ok, that was important for me to know We will be more dedicated to the logic of comparison PN, QR code, codebar and text That's clear for me The card was a nananon Brasio Casser in the Sodor There, simply, it was a image There, it's a lanyard in the Sodor Ok Is it just on this comparison No no no no the but in fact there is a small opening as soon as we see that the info is raised in fact it is very good and the image that I managed to find clearly I have a card that means with a very high resolution but it was really that I was in the photo but apart from that I really took it from a document of control in fact existing but this image that would be enough for me Because on this image I have a little closer I don't have enough images to show you\n",
      "(681.0, 681.64)--> Because on this image I have allowed you to get closer to the camera All that I need to know is that on the Vue de Dauball there are a lot of components on which I control the armature No?\n",
      "(683.64, 684.08)--> I imagine that it's...\n",
      "(685.08, 687.88)--> And... I ask myself how I'm going to do with the cameras\n",
      "(687.88, 726.0)--> Do I sleep once or several times? Ok, I'll see. I'm interested to know if it's a good idea to know how I'm going to do with the camera No, it's a good idea, but I can't do the applications on my side. I don't know if you saw it, because you only made it on the map, are you dancing?\n",
      "(726.0, 747.0)--> In fact, we have a nuclear plane. I don't know if you saw it, because you only made it on the map, you dance in it?\n",
      "(747.0, 744.0)--> In fact, we have a binocular, and the binocular actually, there is a system of elements, it is called a little light in the UB. It's not a very good idea, but it's not something that is absolutely...\n",
      "(744.0, 748.0)--> I think that on the march, to be able to...\n",
      "(748.0, 752.0)--> If I had the reference, it would be...\n",
      "(752.0, 787.0)--> It's nothing. A little ampoule costs 50 euros. I will send you the reference in the studio and I send you, but it's not a special equipment. special no no no at the beginning I believed in the beginning in fact I believed that we put it in a kind of band but not's a piece of light I change the color of the light I'm interested if you have the dream I will note in my video Ok, it's clear for me, we have the habit.\n",
      "(806.0, 808.0)--> Ok, present, a hard-to-get presence, so for the transphoes, you put the heads, the sounds and the three sounds, we agree that these two components exist on the map. You press it or you press it? Wait, you talk about which one? Oh yes, yes, that one. That one, you press one, it's one.\n",
      "(808.0, 810.0)--> It's two things, it's two components.\n",
      "(810.0, 867.0)--> That one and the other one. Not that, there was another image that looks like that. I don't know where it is. But in the presentation, they are good. Yes, it's that one. It looks like it, but it's not the same. I'm talking about the bigger and wider the bigger and wider. Do you see them? How many components are there on the map? My question is whether my camera should zoom in or not. I think it's a zoom on this... the\n",
      "(867.0, 860.0)-->\n",
      "(863.56, 869.0)--> I think it's a zoom on these two components and so it's four small paths to control because each transport has a path above and below\n",
      "(869.0, 873.0)--> and that's it, in fact, zoom is just for that\n",
      "(873.0, 877.0)--> otherwise we are calm, the rest is far away\n",
      "(877.0, 878.0)--> yeah, that's right\n",
      "(878.0, 881.0)--> yeah, it's there to zoom it out, that's it\n",
      "(881.0, 928.28)--> and otherwise, but it doesn't take. So the operators are used to control it by the shape of the weld. It must be flat. Flat, flat, flat.

I will answer your question, how do I generate the defects, for things I could have revised, and I will use it in the future. And that's it. Regarding the labels, there is something I wanted to say. It must be understood, as we say, label is already black, we said. It must be done well in positioning, it is important that it is well presented on the frame. It must be passed a little too low.

      "(1654.0, 1771.76)--> The Parani zones paint that's it it's around the vis because it's full normally it's about as soon as there are metal pieces that a area of the paint that means that the verni does not stop that's why you need the light you see it so you can see it well. Yes, yes, sure. So you realize that there is no glass. And on the metal parts, there is no glass. On the plastic parts, the connectors, there is no glass of glass either. That's also what we're looking at. Ok. I'm going to send you the presentation, you'll see it. And here it is for me. I have another question, because I used the Modochrome cameras, they have one color, because they have good resolutions at home. Are you interested in having cameras with colors? because because the monochromes, that's to do tests, but in the final use, do you want to have color cameras or the fact that having a monochrome does not suit you? As soon as it detects the default, it's not bad. After, is there a question of cuts, perhaps, to reduce of cuts? It's a question of ergonomics. When we go up an alert, there are problems. It's easier to see the area where there is a detected anomaly with colors. a monochrome is detected well but when the user has a photo of the default maybe with\n",
      "(1771.76, 1763.0)--> colors it will be easier for him to position himself on the image to find the Max, what do you think about it?\n",

      "(1786.0, 1907.0)--> by mail if ever, but for now, I think it's not. OK, very good. So, what we're going to do with the research team, which is present in the Union, is that for each ICAM or specific control, we're going to create a set of image, by making acquisitions with the instructions that we have shown. We will generate our own OK images if possible, by adding small particles, by deforming the image, by masking for example the labels. And we will do a test on an image sample, and we will give you the result of feasibility for each control what are the conditions of success and we will make in the end a balance of FESA on the whole of the controls that we have done to know what is FESA what is not FESA, what are the conditions of success and we will share and we will have to of this study because there is also Patrick, who is interested in the return of this feasibility and suddenly I make a state of feasibility by control and possibly propose at the end a setup with a number of cameras to put in place to make this diversity For the moment how many cameras do you have? I have a minimum of 6 I see a minimum of 6 because what I noticed is that I zoomed too much on the screen, on the cameras, but if we talk about the future of the labels, we can visualize it with a global view image. We can see that the SD and 2 SD are there.\n",
      "(1907.0, 1910.0)--> This image is not optimized.\n",
      "(1910.0, 2052.0)--> I can delete cameras and mutualize with others Perfect And about the... There we talked about the biggest And the most complicated I think And about the little one The E37013 Yeah And what does it sound haven't advanced on the other one yet I have to understand that it was the priority I will do the same work, once I have the setup for the first one I could easily integrate the second one It will be a return in the same way I hope it will be compatible. Yes, the subject is to know if with the same setup I can control both. If these two different setups, you have to find a way to mutualize. This way, it will be a number of mutual camera d2. You also have to say to yourself, because I have a little more or less, less 2 degrees of freedom because I move my cameras as I want to have the length of the view that interests me but at the moment when I introduce the second card, maybe I will have more constraints to see I want to focus on this card at the beginning, having a fairly detailed return to feasibility and to add the second one, eventually. No problem, no problem. Don't hesitate to come to me if you need anything, be it at least in terms of health. There you go, there you go. On my side, I didn't add anything about bubbles to my side. As for the bubbles, I would like them to be detected. The bubbles, you say? Yes, or the presentation if you want. Here, there is a bubble, you have to zoom it. And here, I found you in the other presentation, a nice photo. So I read the another nice picture, a bubble that makes a bridge between two compositions, it's a chaos, there is a bubble detection Ok. And here we go, but if we detect the bubbles at the limit, the operators will see on their side and they will say to themselves, it's a chaos.\n",

      "(2844.0, 2926.0)--> It's on the left. the The point is that it is made of different pan-kitsch. Is it made of batteries? I don't know how how does it feel? It's very good. It depends on what you do. With the D9, I have a feeling that it will be a good experience. I don't know if it worked well or not. Because the working well when you put it on. So you have to change the batteries. These are batteries, batteries are non-rechargeable. Yes, it's not critical. You have to change them. I can test them on the phone. I can test them\n",

I'm not going to be in a whole immersion. I'm going to talk to Carlos. You can go to the gym. I'm going to sit down. You can go to the studio Oh, I'm going to the studio No, I'm going here too Come on, look Come on, come on Come on, come on Come on, come on Come on, come on It's not very reassuring It's the guy who didn't have to go to the gym? I want to do it quickly. She's got a lot of pressure. Do you understand? You don the Maghreb? I can tell you the Maghreb Maghreb The Maghreb of Canard Wow, totally different Maybe I'm a little bit... But you weren't paid for it, it's not bad What is this, I think you heardD cut-off? It's an observation of the second of the general.\n",
      "(3185.0, 3186.0)--> Really?\n",
