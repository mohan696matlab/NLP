Literature Review: A practical review of diffusion-based image editing techniques was conducted, and state-of-the-art methods were reimplemented using Hugging Face and PyTorch in Python.  

Image Generation: An end-to-end pipeline was created using a custom fine-tuned diffusion model to generate realistic images for industrial applications with limited data, reducing the error rate by 50%.  

Model Optimization: The Hugging Face transformer library and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods were leveraged for quick training of the diffusion model with minimal samples, optimizing performance.  

Controlled Image Generation: The diffusion model was integrated with control nets to generate text on images, deployed internally using Git and Docker, enabling the creation of images from rare classes.  

Anomaly Detection: A literature review on visual anomaly detection methods was conducted, and a state-of-the-art anomaly detection method was applied for industrial quality control using OpenCV and PyTorch.  

Quality Inspection: A vision anomaly detection model was developed for real-time quality inspection in collaboration with a large automotive client, improving speed by 85% without compromising performance. Collaborated with the development team for deployment and coordinated with the product team for post-production monitoring.  

Object Tracking: Led a project for an international aerospace company, delivering a real-time contamination estimation system that was 10x faster than manual methods. Utilized OpenCV, Python, and deep learning techniques for model development. Collaborated with cross-functional teams for deployment and integration.  

OCR Enhancement: Fine-tuned a transformer-based multimodal OCR detector on a custom dataset, replacing the previous OCR model and achieving an 8% increase in F1-score. This improvement contributed to higher product sales, generating an additional €200,000 in revenue.  

Object Segmentation: Developed an automated system for object segmentation and size estimation using the Segment Anything Model, integrating OpenCV and Scikit-Learn for enhanced computer vision processing. Generated detailed reports in a fully automated manner, contributing to €60,000 in revenue.  

Object Detection: A new YOLO model was trained for object detection and compared with other detection methods. Implemented using CI/CD pipelines, resulting in a 4x faster inference speed.
