    "We'll then use the tokenizer to convert the conversation into actual tokens and fit them into the LLaMA model. After that, we'll use the generate method to create the output, setting maximum tokens to 1000 to keep the summary concise. Finally, we'll decode the output back into readable text, skipping special tokens.\n",
